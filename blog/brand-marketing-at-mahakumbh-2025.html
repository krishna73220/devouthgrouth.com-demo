                                <p>One of the biggest human gatherings on the planet, the Mahakumbh, has been held in
                                    144 years. There are 3 Kumbh - ArdhKumbh in 6 years, Kumbh in 12 years, and
                                    Mahakumbh which is still going on in 2025, covering 4 cities Haridwar, Prayagraj,

                            <p>Can you imagine the humongous size of Kumbh Mela? A mind boggling count of 40 crore
                                people attend this festival, at least 1/3rd of the entire nation's population. It spread
                                4000 massive acres of land. </p>
                            <p>Mahakumbh is the perfect occasion for a cultural and business equation. As we can
                                estimate from the data, the marketing budget has skyrocketed by 300% since 2013 and is
                                currently at the edge of 4500 cr, a 70-100% increase since 2019. </p>
                            <p>It is also an economic engine for a nation that generates Rs 2 lakh crore revenue. </p>
                            <p>If you are a marketeer, this is a place where you can find practically every age group,
                                personality, and profession that you might want to target.
