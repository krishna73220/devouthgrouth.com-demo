                                tips. </p>

                            <h3>PUTTING ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR FMCG PRODUCT PROMOTION</h3>

                            <p><strong>Just imagine</strong>:  If HUNDRED people watch the ad in the video, and if 30% of the audience pays attention to the ad, then imagine how it becomes effective for the product in selling. There will be a sure-shot rise in the sale of the FMCG product.</p>
                            <p>So, that's the reason putting ads related to the product on the video becomes effective.</p>
                            <p>Apart from that paid advertising is an also important part of FMCG products Marketing. Paid ads amplify your reach of the product. We can use tools like Meta Ads Manager to target specific groups of products based on interest, location, and all.</p>

                            <p>Influencers' hashtags help in promoting the products. Influencers' unboxing videos also help promote some of the products like mobile phone unboxing, beauty kits unboxing, and many more.</p>
                            <h3>MEASURE AND OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE</h3>
                            <p>After hitting the "post", the job is not done. We need to monitor the performance of the campaigns like engagement rates, impressions, click-through rates, etc.</p>
