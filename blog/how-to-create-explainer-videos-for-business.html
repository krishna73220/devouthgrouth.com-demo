                                        owner</strong>, neglecting explainer videos in your Marketing strategy means
                                    losing lots of potential customers and leads.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Let's think like a typical user. There's no doubt that short videos are very popular
                                nowadays. But if your expensive AC broke down, I'm pretty sure you'd watch an explainer
                                video instead of a short video. That's the beauty of explainer videos; serious users
                                always consume <strong style=" color: #d63384;">Explainer videos</strong> rather than
                                Short content.</p>

                                or services in depthly and providing you knowledge about their product that how things
                                work or how the product/services are beneficial for your life in the most understandable
                                format. </p>
                            <p>They take the help of their elixir element - <strong style=" color: #d63384;">Explainer
                                    videos</strong>. Let's know together what it's all about and how you and I respond
                                to it.</p>

                            <h2>What is an Explainer Video?</h2>
                            <p>In the easiest way - <em>An explainer video is a simple video which breaks down a topic
                                    in the most understandable form to help you out from an issue.</em></p>
                            <p>The main content of the explainer videos is a mixture of storytelling and brand
                                promotion. It helps you to learn the new elements and concepts step by step and helps to

                                just-in-time concepts and then they prepare videos for their target audience. </p>
                            <p>Now let’s grasp the method of making an explainer video step-by-step:- </p>
                            <ul class="dg-blog-height">
                                <li><strong>Script:</strong> Engaging content is ruling social media because it has been
                                    backed by a strong script. A well-written script is essential for a successful
                                    explainer video. It is important to know the main message that needs to be conveyed
                                    to the audience.</li>
                                <li><strong>Concise and Short length:</strong> The videos need to be short. Bond (2008)
                                    describes this fact based on his research (<strong>a project including more than
                                        1,000 participants</strong>). He learned that “short videos of 1 to 4 minutes
                                    are ideal” and points out that “short 3- or 4-minute YouTube videos help an
                                    instructor to make a key point without having to sacrifice a significant amount of
                                    time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> To keep a video short and to explain the core message to the
                                    target group, it is necessary to keep the content as simple as possible. In the
                                    first step, it is important to focus on the “why” rather than on “what” or the
                                    “how”. </li>
                                <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> It is a fundamental and powerful element of explainer
                                    videos. It is the most effective way to engage and persuade an audience as people’s
                                    brains become activated when a good story is told.</li>
                                <li><strong>Visual: </strong>Graphics can have an immense effect on the audience and can
                                    captivate their imagination. By using metaphoric imagery, the main points of an
                                    explanation can be contextualised, making the core message easier to understand and
                                    stick with the audience.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Brands use these KPIs (Key performance indicators ) to measure their video results</p>
                            <ul class="dg-blog-height">
                                <li><strong>Boost social sharing </strong></li>

                                <li><strong>Improve SEOs </strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Through these indicators, brands analyse the results and update their videos.
                                By using these basic steps they create astounding results.</p>
                            <p>Big brands use these processes to produce a single explainer video which triggers our
                                psychology. </p>
                            <p>You can take the help of AI tools also which are going to create all these for you in
